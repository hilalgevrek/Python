# Python

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a Python library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays 
and matrices, as well as a wide range of mathematical functions to manipulate and operate on these arrays. 
NumPy is one of the core libraries used in scientific computing and data analysis with Python.

NumPy provides a powerful and efficient array data structure that is essential for many scientific and 
numerical computing tasks. It allows users to perform a wide range of operations on arrays, such as 
mathematical operations, slicing, indexing, and reshaping. These operations can be performed on arrays of 
any dimensionality, which makes it easy to work with large datasets and perform complex calculations.

In addition to its array data structure, NumPy also provides a range of functions for performing common 
mathematical operations, such as trigonometric functions, statistical functions, and linear algebra operations. 
These functions are highly optimized for performance, which makes NumPy an ideal library for numerical computing tasks.

NumPy is an open-source library and is available for free, making it accessible to a wide range of users. 
It is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning applications in Python.
