# Python

Pandas is an open-source Python library used for data manipulation, analysis, and cleaning. It provides 
data structures for efficiently storing and manipulating large and complex datasets, and provides tools 
for data wrangling, filtering, grouping, and visualization.

The two primary data structures provided by Pandas are Series and DataFrame. A Series is a one-dimensional 
array-like object that can hold any data type, such as integers, floats, strings, or Python objects. 
A DataFrame is a two-dimensional tabular data structure that is similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table, 
with rows and columns of data.

Pandas provides a wide range of functions and methods for manipulating and analyzing data, such as merging, 
joining, grouping, and pivoting data, as well as handling missing data and reshaping datasets. It also provides 
powerful indexing and selection capabilities for selecting subsets of data based on various criteria.

Pandas also has a built-in visualization capability that allows users to create plots and graphs to help 
visualize data. It integrates well with other Python libraries for scientific computing and data analysis, 
such as NumPy and Matplotlib.

Pandas is widely used in data analysis and data science applications, including finance, economics, social 
sciences, and healthcare. Its intuitive syntax and powerful features make it a popular choice for data analysts 
and scientists who need to manipulate and analyze large and complex datasets.
